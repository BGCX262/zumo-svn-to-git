#summary Code conventions through the Zumo Framework.

= Introduction =

Internal coding style, formatting and patterns used thorough the sources of the Zumo Framework.


= Conventions =

  * Use spaces instead of tabs

  * Lines should not be longer than 120 characters

  * When a line is too long, break after an operator; the next line should start matching the group opener (e.g. parenthesis)

 * Framework objects (singletons) are preceded with 2 line breaks and a comment line with format:
   `// *** {OBJECT NAME} - OBJECT`
   
   Where {OBJECT NAME} is the actual name of the !JavaScript object in uppercase and with spaces between words (e.g. !XmlConfParser becomes XML CONF PARSER)

 * Framework constructor functions (classes) are preceded with 2 line breaks and a comment line with format
   `// *** {FUNCTION NAME} - CONSTRUCTOR`

   Where {FUNCTION NAME} is the actual name of the !JavaScript function in uppercase and with spaces between words (e.g. !HandlerManager becomes HANDLER MANAGER)
